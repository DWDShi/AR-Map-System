# AR-Map-System
migrated over from old repo, Prototype result of an AR group project

If you are using the unity editor to inspect it, you might want to use an android device in some way to get it to run properly. While it will "function" if directly ran from the editor, the actual fucnctionality will be hard to see.

The mapping system was created for a specific real-life section of a hallway with many potential places which the user may want to go to, thus if you were to use it on an actual phone it will likely not guide you to the place you want to go unless you were in the exact place which this was created for. It works off of scanning qr codes which would be placed around to tell the application where you are and which direction you are facing, and then directing the user with a line on the ground visible through a camera.
